# HolyH

Extensions to C inspired by HolyC, intended for SurRender

This is a header-only library. Add it to your project as a git submodule and then do...
```c
#include "<path_to_holyh>/src/holy.h"
```

`holy.h` is the file you are intended to include. Do not include any other file directly from your project.

**Documentation coming soon.**
